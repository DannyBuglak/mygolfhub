# MyGolfHub

 A React website with a Flask backend

## Explanation

 This is a website that will allow users to enter, store, and track their golf statistics. They will have to manually enter the distance of each hole and can keep track of:
 * FIR (Fairways in Regulation)
 * GIR (Greens in Regulation)
 * PPH (Putts per Hole)
 * OB (Out of Bounds)
 * Drop
 * Mulligan

 It is a website with multiple pages that will allow a user to achieve this.

### Notes

 Websites like this already exist, but this is my attempt at creating an entire website using a React framework for the frontend, a Flask framework for the backend, and MySQL for storing data. The webpage will be containerized using Docker.

#### Updates
